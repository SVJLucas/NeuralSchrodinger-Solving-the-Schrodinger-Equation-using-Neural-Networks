# NeuralSchrodinger-Solving-the-Schrodinger-Equation-using-Neural-Networks

This repository contains a set of scripts and Jupyter notebooks for solving the Schrödinger equation using neural networks. The Schrödinger equation describes the behavior of quantum systems and plays a central role in quantum mechanics. However, solving the Schrödinger equation can be a computationally intensive task, especially for complex systems.

**This is where neural networks come in: they can be trained to approximate the solution of the Schrödinger equation, making the calculations faster and more efficient.**

The repository includes code for defining the Schrödinger equation in the appropriate system of units and using the Sympy library to manipulate mathematical expressions. It also includes a function for computing the Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates, which is needed for the Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom. The neural network architecture used in this repository is based on a feedforward neural network with multiple hidden layers, and the training is done using the Pytorch framework.

The scripts and notebooks in this repository can be used as a starting point for solving the Schrödinger equation for other quantum systems, or for exploring the properties of the hydrogen atom. The code is well-documented and easy to customize, and can be adapted to different applications and research projects in quantum mechanics and computational physics.
